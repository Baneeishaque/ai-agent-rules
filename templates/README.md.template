## 🎯 Overview

**AI Agent Rules** is a comprehensive collection of standardized rules, best practices, and protocols designed to govern AI agent behavior in software development workflows. This framework ensures:

- **Transparency**: Every AI action is visible and auditable
- **User Control**: Users maintain ultimate authority over all operations
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all development activities
- **Security**: Principle of least privilege and explicit permission protocols

The repository provides a modular, extensible rule system that can be adopted by AI coding assistants, development tools, and automated workflows to establish a trustworthy and effective interaction model.

## 📖 Detailed Rule Reference

### Core Planning Protocol (ai-agent-planning-rules.md)

The foundational rule that all agents must follow:

```markdown
1. Deconstruct the Request → Analyze user intent
2. Formulate the Plan    → Create step-by-step approach
3. Present for Approval  → Seek user confirmation
4. Execute the Plan      → Implement approved steps
5. Report Progress       → Summarize completion
```

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Always plan before acting
- ✅ Plans must be explicit and actionable
- ✅ Support iterative plan revisions
- ✅ Handle ambiguous requests with clarification

### Tool Execution Protocol (ai-tools-rules.md)

```markdown
Core Principles:
- Transparency      → Full visibility of all tool actions
- User Control      → User maintains ultimate authority
- Full Output       → Never truncate stdout/stderr
- Least Privilege   → Minimum necessary permissions
```

**Mandatory User Confirmation Required For:**
- File write operations
- GitHub CLI commands
- Any destructive operations

### Shell Execution Guidelines (shell-execution-rules.md)

```bash
# Always explain critical commands before execution
# Display full output (stdout + stderr)
# Prefer non-interactive commands when possible
# Use background processes (&) for long-running tasks
```

### Flutter Development (flutter-app-development-rules.md)

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Use Mise for version management
mise install              # Install SDK versions from mise.toml
mise use flutter@3.x.x    # Pin Flutter version
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
flutter analyze           # Lint with zero warnings
dart format .             # Format all code
flutter test --coverage   # Run tests with coverage
```

**Project Structure:**
```
lib/
├── src/
│   ├── features/         # Feature modules
│   │   ├── feature_name/
│   │   │   ├── domain/   # Business logic
│   │   │   ├── presentation/  # UI
│   │   │   └── data/     # Data sources
│   ├── common/           # Shared utilities
│   ├── core/             # App configuration
│   └── main.dart
```

### CI/CD Best Practices (ci-cd-rules.md)

**GitHub Actions Optimization:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    fetch-depth: 1        # Shallow clone for speed
    sparse-checkout: true # Only needed directories
```

**Security:**
- Use OIDC for cloud authentication
- Never hardcode secrets
- Protected branches required
- Automated secret rotation

**Deployment Orchestration:**
```
Supabase → GitHub Actions → Render
   ↓            ↓              ↓
  Router     Executor      Runtime
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Planning a Feature Implementation

```markdown
Agent: I will implement the user authentication feature. Here is my plan:

1. Create the authentication model in `lib/src/features/auth/domain/`
2. Implement the auth repository with Firebase integration
3. Build the login screen widget
4. Add unit tests for auth logic
5. Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`

Do you approve this plan?
```

### Example 2: Safe Shell Execution

```markdown
Agent: I need to run the following command to install dependencies:

Command: npm install
Purpose: Install project dependencies from package.json
Location: ~/projects/my-app/

Do you want me to proceed?
```

### Example 3: GitHub CLI with Permission

```markdown
Agent: I need to clone the repository. Here is the command:

gh repo clone Baneeishaque/AI-Agent-Rules ~/sample/path/AI-Agent-Rules

This will clone the repository to your local machine.
Do you approve this command? Yes/No
```

### Example 4: Brew Upgrade with Exclusions

```bash
# User: "upgrade except google-chrome@canary"

# Agent runs dry-run, filters results, presents:
brew upgrade --greedy --verbose gh node ollama discord@ptb postman
```

### With Custom AI Assistants

Include rule files in your system prompt or context:

```python
# Example: Loading rules into context
with open('ai-agent-planning-rules.md', 'r') as f:
    agent_rules = f.read()
    
system_prompt = f"""
You are an AI assistant. Follow these rules:
{agent_rules}
"""
```

### With GitHub Actions

Reference CI/CD rules in your workflow:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1  # As per ci-cd-rules.md
```

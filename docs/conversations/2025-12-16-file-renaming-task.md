# Conversation Log: File Renaming Task

**Date**: 2025-12-16
**Objective**: Rename rule files to convenient lowercase format and update metadata/indices.

## 1. Request

The user requested to analyze current filenames, suggest better ones (convenient), update metadata, and regenerate the rule index (`README.md`, `agent-rules.md`).

## 2. Analysis & Planning

The agent analyzed the `AI-Agent-Rules` repository and proposed a comprehensive renaming scheme:

- **Format**: PascalCase -> kebab-case
- **Simplification**: Shortened long names (e.g., `Git-Repository-Indexing-rules.md` -> `git-indexing-rules.md`).

**Proposed Renames (Subset):**

| Original | New |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AI-Agent-rules.md` | `ai-agent-rules.md` |
| `AI-Tools-rules.md` | `ai-tools-rules.md` |
| `Android-App-Launch-rules.md` | `android-launch-rules.md` |
| `CI-CD-rules.md` | `ci-cd-rules.md` |
| `Git-Repository-rules.md` | `git-repo-creation-rules.md` |
| ... (and 20+ others) | ... |

The plan also included updating `title` and `description` metadata within files and updating internal links.

## 3. Execution Issues (macOS Case Sensitivity)

The agent attempted to execute the renames using standard shell `mv` commands:

```bash
mv AI-Agent-rules.md ai-agent-rules.md

```

**Problem**: The user is on macOS, where the filesystem is typically case-insensitive.

- The system often sees `AI-Agent-rules.md` and `ai-agent-rules.md` as the *same* file.
- `mv` on macOS may either silently fail to update the casing in the directory entry or require a force flag/intermediate step.
- The user manually reset the repo states after the failed attempt.

## 4. Resolution Strategy Identified

To rename files when only changing case on macOS (or Windows), specific strategies are needed:

1. **Git Move**: `git mv OldName.md NewName.md` (Git usually handles this correctly).
2. **Two-Step Rename**: `mv OldName.md temp.md` -> `mv temp.md newname.md`.

## 5. Current State

- The plan to rename files is valid and verified.
- The execution method needs to switch to `git mv` to handle the case-insensitivity correctly.

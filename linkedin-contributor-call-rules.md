# LinkedIn Contributor Call Rules

This document defines the mandatory protocol for creating "Call for Contributors" posts. Unlike standard educational
posts, these are recruitment-focused and follow a specific "Mission-First" structure.

***

## 1. Preparation & Context Assembly

Before drafting, the agent MUST:

1. **Define the Project Scope**: Is it CLI, Web, or Mobile? (e.g., "Unified Work Logger CLI").

1. **Identify the Pain Point**: Who suffers? (e.g., "Contractors tracking billable hours").

1. **Clarify the Tech Stance**: emphasize "Labor-Rich" and "Voting-Based" decisions over hype.

***

### 2. Structural Directives

The post MUST follow this strict section order:

#### 2.1 The Hook

- Identify the target audience immediately (e.g., "Contractors and freelancers know this pain").

- State the problem clearly (e.g., "Tools live in silos").

#### 2.2 THE MISSION (Header)

- Define the tool (Personal Project).

- Define the goal (e.g., "Orchestrate work from chaos").

- **Leadership Tone**: State "I could build this myself, but I find value in leading a team." (Mentorship focus).

#### 2.3 THE TECH (Header)

- **Philosophy**: "Labor-Rich", "Fast Development", "Decided by You".

- **Stack listing**: List broad options (Node, Go, Rust, etc.) to attract maximum talent.

- **Database**: Prefer file-based first, generic DBs (Postgres, Mongo) second.

#### 2.4 THE CHALLENGE (Header)

- Prove it's not "just CRUD".

- List specific automation challenges (ADB, Screen Mirroring, API interception).

- **Group by Channel**: Whatsapp, Teams, Voice Calls.

#### 2.5 THE REWARD (Header)

- **Mentorship First**: "I will lead and orchestrate."

- **Visibility**: "Product needed by industry."

- **Future**: Mention potential SaaS evolution but focus on the "now".

#### 2.6 The CTA

- **DM Only**: "DM me your preferred stack."

- **No Comments**: Polite instruction ("Please do not comment") to manage workflow efficiency.

***

### 3. Formatting Standards

- **Headers**: Use **ALL CAPS** for main sections (THE MISSION, THE TECH).

- **Spacing**: Double line breaks between sections.

- **No Underlines**: Do NOT use `___`or`---` dividers.

- **Bullets**: Use standard dashes `-`or bullets`•`.

***

### 4. Visual Asset Standards (Architecture)

- **Style**: "Future Tech" / Architectural Blueprint.

- **Composition**:

- **Center**: Glowing Core (The Engine).

- **Surround**: Floating icons of data sources (WhatsApp, Teams, Phone).

- **Flow**: Data streams feeding the core.

- **Colors**: Dark grid, Neon Blue/Green accents. Professional, not cyberpunk.

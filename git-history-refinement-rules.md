# Git History Refinement Rules

This document defines the mandatory protocol for refining or reconstructing existing git commit history. This is used
when commits contain mixed concerns (e.g., non-atomic JSON changes) that need to be split or re-ordered while
preserving history quality and tree integrity.

***

## 1. Safety First: The Backup Protocol

The agent **MUST** create a backup branch before performing any destructive history operations (`reset --hard`,
`rebase`, etc.).

### 1.1 Incremental Branch Naming

To prevent overwriting existing backups and to maintain a trail of refinement attempts, use an incrementing suffix:

1. **Prefix**: `backup/pre-settings-split-` (or descriptive equivalent).

1. **Check**: Run `git branch --list "prefix*"` to see current versions.

1. **Increment**: Select the first integer `n`that does NOT have a corresponding branch (e.g., if`-1`and`-2` exist,

   use `-3`).

1. **Workspace Preservation**: Before creating the branch, stage all local changes and create a temporary "state

   preservation" commit. This ensures the backup captures the exact state of the workspace including uncommitted
   changes.

1. **Creation**: Create the branch using `git branch <name>`. **DO NOT** use`-f` to force-move a branch.

***

## 2. Methodology: Reconstruction via Extraction

When splitting changes across existing commits, use the "Reset and Restore" strategy to reconstruct the history atop a
clean baseline.

### 2.1 The Baseline Reset

Reset the active branch (e.g., `master`) to the last known "clean" commit before the messy historical segment.

```bash
git reset --hard <clean-commit-hash>

```bash

#### 2.1.1 Root Commit Refinement

If the refinement involves the first commit (root) of the repository, use an orphan branch:

```bash
git checkout --orphan temp-master
git rm -rf .

```bash

This allows reconstructing the history from scratch while preserving the repository's identity.

### 2.2 Atomic JSON Manipulation (jq)

When a JSON file (like `.vscode/settings.json`) needs to be split across commits, use`jq` to extract exactly the
relevant keys for the current atomic unit.

1. **Extract Original**: Fetch the final version from the backup.

    ```bash
    git show <backup-branch>:<path/to/file.json> > <file.json>.bak
    ```bash

1. **Filter with jq**: Create a valid JSON containing only the commit-specific keys.

    ```bash
    jq '{ "specific.key": .["specific.key"] }' <file.json>.bak > <file.json>
    ```bash

1. **Verification**: The agent MUST verify the generated JSON is valid before staging.

    ```bash
    jq . <file.json>
    ```bash

#### 2.2.1 Canonical Sorting and Formatting

When manipulating JSON arrays (e.g., `cSpell.words`), the agent **MUST** preserve or enforce the project's standard
sort order to prevent history misalignment across commits.

1. **Inspection**: Examine neighboring commits to determine the expected sort order (e.g., ASCII vs. case-insensitive

   natural sort).

1. **Consistency**: Ensure the sort order is applied identically at every stage of the reconstruction.

1. **Tooling**: Prefer stable sorting tools or scripts (e.g., Python's `sorted(key=str.lower)`) over standard`jq` sort

   if case-insensitivity is required.

### 2.3 Metadata Preservation

When re-creating commits that originally had specific messages and timestamps, use the original commit's hash to
preserve metadata.

```bash
git commit -C <original-hash>

```bash

### 2.4 Sequential Integrity (Protocol Files)

When refining history for documents containing numbered phases or state-dependent protocols (e.g.,
`git-atomic-commit-construction-rules.md`), the agent **MUST** maintain structural validity at *every* intermediate
commit.

- **The Valid-Sequence Rule**: Every commit in the refined history MUST result in a valid 1-N sequence of phases. No

    gaps, no duplicates, and no "broken" intermediate states.

- **Micro-Renumbering**: If a commit adds Phases 4 and 5, and the original file already had a Phase 4 (now 6), the

    agent MUST renumber all subsequent phases within that same atomic unit to preserve immediate validity.

### 2.5 Remote Baseline Reconciliation

Before starting any history refinement, the agent MUST synchronize with the remote source of truth to prevent
divergence.

1. **Mandatory Fetch**: `git fetch origin <branch>`

1. **Reconciliation**: If `origin/<branch>` contains commits not present in the local branch, the agent MUST:
 - Identify the latest remote commit as the new "Refinement Baseline".
 - Re-execute the reconstruction atop this reconciled baseline.

1. **Submodule Awareness**: This protocol applies recursively to submodules. Never begin a submodule refinement without

   a `git -C <path> pull` or fetch.

### 2.6 Pre-Execution Analysis (Mandatory)

Commit messages and change descriptions MUST be derived from actual file analysis, not assumptions.

1. **Read Before Writing**: Before finalizing any commit message, the agent MUST:
 - Read the current state of affected files (`git show <base-commit>:<file>`)
 - Read the target state of affected files (from backup or target branch)
 - Perform explicit `git diff` comparisons to identify exact changes

1. **Evidence-Based Messages**: Commit messages must reflect ACTUAL changes observed, not planned or assumed changes.

1. **No Placeholder Content**: Never use generic descriptions like "update metadata" without specifying which metadata

   fields were changed and how.

### 2.7 Link Verification (Mandatory)

For EVERY file rename operation, the agent MUST perform global link verification to prevent broken references.

1. **Immediate Grep Check**: After each `git mv` operation, run:

   ```bash
   grep -r "Old-Filename.md" . --exclude-dir=.git
   ```bash

1. **Update All References**: Use `sed` or manual edits to update ALL discovered references, including:
 - Internal documentation links
 - Template files (e.g., `templates/README.md.template`)
 - Architecture documents
 - Rule cross-references

1. **Exclusion Protocol**: Exclude CI/CD-managed files (e.g., `README.md`,`agent-rules.md`) from manual edits if they

   are auto-generated.

1. **Final Verification**: Before committing, re-run the grep check with `--exclude` flags for managed files to confirm

   cleanup.

### 2.8 Preserving Dependent Commits (Cherry-Pick Protocol)

When splitting a commit that has subsequent commits built on top of it, the agent MUST preserve those dependent commits.

1. **Identify Dependents**: After splitting, list all commits created after the split commit:

    ```bash
    git log --oneline <split-commit>..HEAD
    ```bash

1. **Sequential Cherry-Pick**: Reapply each dependent commit in chronological order:

    ```bash
    git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
    ```bash

1. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts arise:

- Resolve them while preserving the original commit's intent

- Use `git show <original-hash>` to reference the original changes

- Mark conflicts as resolved: `git add <file>`

- Continue: `git cherry-pick --continue`

1. **Verification**: After all cherry-picks, verify the final tree state matches the pre-refinement state:

    ```bash
    git diff HEAD <backup-branch>
    ```bash

    Expected: Empty diff (tree parity maintained).

***

## 2.9 Hierarchical Rebase Coordination

For complex multi-branch operations or chain rebasing, the agent MUST follow the **[Git Rebase Standardization
Rules](./git-rebase-standardization-rules.md)** to ensure graph integrity and eliminate cross-branch redundancies.

***

## 3. Verification & Parity

The "Arranged Result" of the refined history MUST match the "Original Result" in final state (the code tree), even if
the intermediate steps differ.

### 3.1 Content-Level Verification

After each commit in the reconstruction, use `git show` to confirm only the intended changes were introduced.

```bash
git show HEAD

```bash

### 3.2 Tree Parity Check (Mandatory)

After the final commit in the refinement process, the current branch MUST be compared to the backup.

```bash
git diff <current-branch> <backup-branch>

```bash

**Constraint**: The diff MUST be empty. Any discrepancy indicates a regression introduced during the refinement process.

***

## 4. Finalization

The agent is **BLOCKED** from deleting backup branches automatically.

- **Protocol**: Provide a walkthrough of the refined history.

- **Authorization**: Request explicit user confirmation before deleting any backup branches created under Section 1.

    The agent is **PROHIBITED** from deleting these automatically.

***

## 2.9 Post-Refinement Remote Push Protocol

After history refinement, if the remote has diverged, the agent MUST reconcile before pushing.

### 2.9.1 Pre-Push Remote Backup (MANDATORY)

Before any destructive operation (force-push), the agent MUST create a backup of the remote state.

```bash
git branch backup/pre-force-push-<n> origin/<branch>

```bash

1. **Naming**: Use incremental integers `<n>` to avoid overwriting existing backups.

1. **Verification**: Confirm backup existence:

   ```bash
   git branch --list "backup/pre-force-push-*"
   ```bash

### 2.9.2 Remote Divergence Analysis

Analyze the gap between the remote and the refined local history.

```bash
git fetch origin <branch>
git log <refinement-baseline>..origin/<branch> --oneline --graph --decorate

```bash

### 2.9.3 Commit Categorization Protocol

Assign every remote commit to exactly one category:

| Category | Definition | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New** | Truly unique logic, content, or manual fixes created after refinement started. | MUST Cherry-pick. |
| **Covered** | Changes already present in refined history (renames, splits, formatting). | Skip (User approval required). |
| **Regenerative** | Auto-generated files (e.g., `README.md`, `agent-rules.md`) synced by CI. | Skip (User approval required). |

**Identifying Regenerative Files**:
Check `.github/workflows/`or relevant scripts (e.g.,`sync-rules.py`) to see if the file is a target of automated
generation. If a commit ONLY modifies these files, it is **Regenerative**.

### 2.9.4 Reconciliation Strategy

1. **Present Categorized List**: Present all remote commits, grouped by their assigned categories, to the user.

1. **Mandatory Approval**: The user MUST explicitly approve the categorization and the decision to skip "Covered" or

   "Regenerative" commits.

1. **Cherry-Pick**: Apply only approved "New" commits onto the refined HEAD.

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <hash>
   ```bash

### 2.9.5 Force Push Safety Protocol

1. **Explicit Confirmation**: Request explicit user approval: "I understand that `origin/master` will be replaced.

   Proceed?"

1. **Force with Lease**: Use the lease flag to prevent overwriting unexpected remote changes.

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>
   ```bash

### 2.9.6 Remote Rollback Procedure

If the remote state is incorrect after push, restore it from the backup:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin backup/pre-force-push-<n>:<branch>

```bash

### 2.9.7 Backup Cleanup (After Verification)

Once the user has manually verified the remote state is correct, the backup branch SHOULD be deleted to maintain
repository hygiene.

```bash
git branch -D backup/pre-force-push-<n>

```bash

**CRITICAL**: The agent is **PROHIBITED** from executing this step automatically. It MUST remain a manual instruction
or require separate, explicit authorization.
